# Credit-card-digits-extraction-via-computer-vision
Real time system for digits recognition on low-resolution webcam

The project aim to examine feasibility of extract interesting information out of credit cards by using low resolution camera.<br>
This task is a bit problematic due to the reasons that using laptop webcam will provide low resolution which impairs accuracy, and the second, trying to detect dynamic objects (digits in our case).<br/>
Additionally, credit companies set difficulties (and rightly so) on details extraction to prevent credit theft and frauds, what makes the task challenging.<br/>

I wanted to check wheter CC digits recognition can be done by using a webcam. I searched and discovered tutorials that doing so on a static image (e.g. pyimagesearch great blog), but could not find implemantations on video.
